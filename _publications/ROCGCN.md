## Abstract
We consider the problem of learning Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for relational data. Speciﬁcally, we consider the classic link prediction and node classiﬁcation problems as relational modeling tasks and develop a relational extension to GCNs. Our method constructs a secondary graph using relational density estimation techniques where vertices correspond to the target triples. We emphasize the importance of learning features using the secondary graph and the advantages of employing a distance matrix over the typically used adjacency matrix. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates the superiority of our approach over 12 diﬀerent GCN models, relational embedding techniques, rule learning techniques and relational models.
