## Abstract
We consider the problem of learning distance-based Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for relational data. Specifically, we first embed the original graph into the Euclidean space R^m using a relational density estimation technique thereby constructing a secondary Euclidean graph. The graph vertices correspond to the target triples and edges denote the Euclidean distances between the target triples. We emphasize the importance of learning the secondary Euclidean graph and the advantages of employing a distance matrix over the typically used adjacency matrix. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates the superiority of our approach over 12 different GCN models, relational embedding techniques and rule learning techniques.
