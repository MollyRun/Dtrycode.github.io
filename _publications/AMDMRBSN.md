## Abstract
Online social networks provide a convenient platform for the spread of rumors, which could lead to serious aftermaths such as economic losses and public 
panic. The classical rumor blocking problem aims to launch a set of nodes as a positive cascade to compete with misinformation in order to limit the 
spread of rumors. However, most of the related researches were based on a one-dimensional diffusion model. In reality, there is more than one feature 
associated with an object. A user's impression on this object is determined not just by one feature but by her overall evaluation of all features 
associated with it. Thus, the influence spread of this object can be decomposed into the spread of multiple features. Based on that, we design a 
multi-feature diffusion model (MF-model) in this paper and formulate a multi-feature rumor blocking (MFRB) problem on a multi-layer network structure 
according to this model. To solve the MFRB problem, we design a creative sampling method called Multi-Sampling, which can be applied to this multi-layer 
network structure. Then, we propose a Revised-IMM algorithm and obtain a satisfactory approximate solution to MFRB. Finally, we evaluate our proposed 
algorithm by conducting experiments on real datasets, which shows the effectiveness of our Revised-IMM and its advantage to their baseline algorithms.
